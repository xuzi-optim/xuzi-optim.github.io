Hello! I’m a Professor and doctoral supervisor in [Department of Mathematics](https://math.shu.edu.cn) at [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn), Shanghai, China.

My research focuses on optimization theory and methods and their applications in machine learning. I have published over 40 papers in internationally renowned journals including Mathematical Programming, SIAM Journal on Optimization, Journal of Machine Learning Research, and IEEE JSAC. I have presided over four National Natural Science Foundation of China projects and one Shanghai Natural Science Foundation project. I serve as an executive director of the Mathematical Programming Branch of the Operations Research Society of China and a director of the Shanghai Operations Research Society. I am currently a guest editor of the Springer-published optimization journal Journal of Global Optimization and serve on the editorial boards of international journals such as the Journal of Operations Research Society of China, PLOS One, and Numerical Algebra, Control & Optimization. I have been invited to conduct academic visits and exchanges at institutions such as the University of Minnesota, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. In 2020, I received the Youth Science and Technology Award from the Operations Research Society of China. In 2024, I was selected for the Shanghai Oriental Talent Program.
